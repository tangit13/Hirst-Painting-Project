# Hirst-Painting-Project
The famous hirst painting(sold for 1.5 million dollarsðŸ¤©) built using python. 
Here we have used the colorgram.py which is a Python library that lets you extract colors from images. 
So first we gave the colorgram a picture to scan took the result of it and used it to build our own hirst painting using random choicing.
